# dice_game
Final project of Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path's Module 5: Essential JavaScript Concepts. The object is to be the first player to reach 20 points.

I made two big functionality improvements:
- Had a random starting player be chosen on page load
- Added dice images just for interest

I implemented visual clues to show which player's turn it was, and who won or losed.
